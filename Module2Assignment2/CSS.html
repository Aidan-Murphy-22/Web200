<p>CSS which stands for Cascading Styls Sheets is the languaage that allows a web developer to style their webpage. This allows the developer to alter the layout and style to allow things such as fonts, colors, margind,borders, and a lot more. It is important to for CSS to be incorporated with HTML to create a webpage that is visually appealing and user friendly.</p>
<p>The best way to use CSS is by putting it on its own page and linking it to the HTML page via referance in the head section of the HTML document. For this webpage for example I used various styling options like color to alter the text color, background-color to alter the color of the background and my link buttons. I also used various other styling and format options with CSS and linked them to my 3 HTML documents via the head of the webpages.</p>
