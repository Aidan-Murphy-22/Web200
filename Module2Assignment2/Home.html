    <h1>How HTML and CSS Work Together</h1>
    <div class="a">

    </div>
    <p>HTML and CSS must work together in order to create a webpage that not only has functionality, but aesthetic appeal as well. The primary role of HTML is to create the foundation of the webpage and the structure of it. A good example of this is a house. HTML is the footing/foundation, the framing of the house, the drywall, roof, and and other integral part of the house that makes it a house. CSS fills the role of customizing the appearance and design of the webpage. Think of CSS as the the landscaping, paint colors, the granite countertops, hardwood floors, and tile backsplash which are all add on features to a house. Without these the house is still a house, just as the webpage is technically still a webpage without CSS. It might just not be a webpage that is aesthetically pleasing or user-friendly.</p>
